**Udacity Android nDegree - Project 3**  
This project is part of the Udacity Android online Nano-Degree co-created by Google.

This project consists of two Android applications that need some improvements and corrections to be production ready.

## Football scores

This application shows the today's, and the two previous and next days, football matches and scores. It uses **api.football-data.org** free API to get all football matches.

The improvements consisted on correcting several visual problems, adapt the application form visually impaired people and to create two different widgets, one for a concrete football match and another for all matches of a selected day.

## Alexandria

This application is a personal book library.

The improvements consisted on controlling several unhandled exceptions and to create a camera preview activity from scratch, that uses **com.google.zxing** barcode scan library to allow users to enter books by just scanning the book barcode using the phone camera.


The two projects were already made and required the course **Advanced Andorid App Development**.
